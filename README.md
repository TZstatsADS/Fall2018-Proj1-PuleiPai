### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Happy Moment for Different People: what makes people happy, and how to be happy?
+ This project is conducted by [Peilu Zhang]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] To find out what makes people happy, I count the word frequency so that I can find "friend" is the happy thing shows most often. To find out how to be happy. I use two words relationships to describe. Most people tend to have similar happy moment discription, such as "friend	time",	"game	played", and "celebrate birthday", etc. Participating in those events are ways to be happy. Further, the word correlation shows how likely two words written together.That was another way to explain how to be happy. We could see “simulating discussion" and "ice cream",etc are tend to show together in higher possibility. For different people, I split people into various different country, gender, marriage statu, parenthood. Then explained the difference of happy moments from different kind of people.
