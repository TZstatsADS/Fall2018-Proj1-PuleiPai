# Happy Moment for Different People: what makes people happy, and how to be happy?

My project topic is Happy Moment for Different People: what makes people happy, and how to be happy. To find out what makes people happy, I count the word frequency so that I can find the happy thing shows most often. To find out how to be happy. I use two words relationships to describe. Further, the word correlation shows how likely two words written together. That was another way to explain how to be happy. For different people, I split people into various different country, gender, marriage statu, parenthood. Then explained the difference of happy moments from different kind of people

In general, what makes people happy? We can see from graphs: friend, family, home is top four things makes people happy. Friend is the most important source of happiness. Half people reflect their last happy moment in last 3 months. We guess that is because some people are not easily to be happy nowadays.

If we look our happy moment in a category horizon, we can find people mostly feel happy in affection, achievement and enjoy_the_moment categories. This means our relationships and career are equally important. Within each happy category, Temple for achievement, ai and family for affection, wedding and job for bonding, sleep and eat for enjoy_the_momeng, life and project for exercise, island and travel for leisure, morning and dog for nature. But we also can see the predicted category “achievement” is not that precise.

To be more specific, we split people into different group by their demographic information. For different country, achievement and Affection is the top common happy categories among those countries. We can see the difference in exercise and nature, which Indian people seldom feel happy while excercising or they don’t exercise as frequent as American. For different gender, We can see from wordcloud that male’s happy moment most from achievement, female’s happy moment mostly from affection. This accords with common sense that females are more sensitive than male. And we can guess that male cares about their career and achievements more. For different marital, the words are approximately located on the abline, no obvious outliers. We guess that marriage does not affect happy moment that much. No matter married or single, friend makes people happy most. For peple who have kids, we can see "daughter","son","family" and "husband" is most shown on the wordcloud. Their happy moments occurs more in family life. For people who don't have kids, we can see girlfriend, boyfriend and dog are important happiness source.

### How to be happy?
Now how to be happy? To anwser this question, we look at the network of words. We see some clear clustering in this network of happy moment words; words in happy moments sentences are largely organized into several families of words that tend to go together. Most people tend to have similar happy moment discription, such as “friend time”, “game played”, and “celebrate birthday”, etc. Participating in those events are ways to be happy. Moreover, the correlation network answer a question about which words occur more often together than with other words. This word networks tend to explain how to be happy.
